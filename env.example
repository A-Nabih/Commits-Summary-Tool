# Custom summary prompt template
# If set, this will be used instead of the default prompts based on PROMPT_STYLE.
# The git activity text will be appended to this prompt.
# Leave empty to use default prompts based on PROMPT_STYLE.
#
# Option 1: Use SUMMARY_PROMPT_FILE to load prompt from a file (recommended for multi-line prompts)
# This is the easiest way to write multi-line prompts with special characters like #, quotes, etc.
# SUMMARY_PROMPT_FILE=prompt_template_example.txt
#
# Option 2: Use SUMMARY_PROMPT with a quoted single-line string
# For Python (python-dotenv): Use quotes and \n for newlines. Example:
# SUMMARY_PROMPT="You are an expert technical writer. Create a well-structured Markdown report.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Use clear headings: ## Repository Name\n2. List commits under ### Recent Commits\n3. Highlight changes under ### Notable Uncommitted Changes"
#
# Option 3: Use SUMMARY_PROMPT without quotes (simple single-line, avoid # characters at start of value)
# For bash scripts: The value cannot easily contain # characters or be multi-line.
# Use SUMMARY_PROMPT_FILE instead for complex prompts.
#
# Example single-line prompt (works with both Python and bash, but avoid # characters):
# SUMMARY_PROMPT="You are an expert technical writer. Create a well-structured Markdown report. Use clear headings, list commits, highlight changes."
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use the file-based approach for multi-line prompts with special characters:
SUMMARY_PROMPT_FILE=prompt_template_example.txt
#
# Alternative: Use SUMMARY_PROMPT with a quoted string (Python supports \n for newlines):
# SUMMARY_PROMPT="You are an expert technical writer specializing in software development summaries. Create a well-structured Markdown report from the git activity provided below.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Use clear Markdown headings - for each repository create a section with ## Repository Name\n2. List recent commits in bulleted format with commit hash (short) and subject line under ### Recent Commits\n3. Highlight notable uncommitted changes under ### Notable Uncommitted Changes\n4. Emphasize meaningful changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring) and skip trivial updates\n5. Use professional, concise, action-oriented tone"
